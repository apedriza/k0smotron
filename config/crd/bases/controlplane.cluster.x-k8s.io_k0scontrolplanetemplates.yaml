                                  Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be
                                  set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not
                                  queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

                              NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the machine controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
                              hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
                              If no value is provided, the default value for this property of the Machine resource will be used.

                              NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a controlplane node
