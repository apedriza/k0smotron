# Cluster API - AWS (Hosted Control Plane)

This example demonstrates how k0smotron can be used with CAPA (Cluster API Provider Amazon Web Services) to deploy 
a cluster with hosted control plane and workers in AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this example, ensure that you have met the [general prerequisites](capi-examples.md#prerequisites). In addition to those, you should also have appropriate AWS credentials available and the AWS CLI configured on your local machine.

### Prepare the AWS infra provider

Before launching a cluster, it's crucial to set up your infrastructure provider. Each provider has its unique prerequisites and configuration steps.

Follow the AWS Provider [installation guide](https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started.html#initialize-the-management-cluster) for detailed steps.

## Creating a child cluster

Once all the controllers are up and running, you can apply the cluster manifests containing the specifications of the cluster you want to provision.

!!! note "k0smotron in standalone mode is only able to work with [externally managed](https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/topics/bring-your-own-aws-infrastructure.html) cluster infrastructure."
    This is because in CAPA there is no way to disable it to provision all control plane related infrastructure (VPC, ELB, etc.).
    This also renders k0smotron unable to dynamically edit the `AWSCluster` API endpoint details. Make sure your VPC and subnets you are planning to use fullfill the [needed prerequisites](https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/topics/bring-your-own-aws-infrastructure.html#prerequisites).
    This limitation is not applicable to the clusters on the VMs.

Here is an example:

Once complete, your command line should display output similar to this:

```shell
% kubectl get cluster,machine

```

You can also check the status of the cluster deployment with `clusterctl`:
```shell
% clusterctl describe cluster

### Networking Options
k0smotron, running in a management cluster in AWS, supports flexible networking options, allowing you to choose between Network Load Balancers (NLB) and Classic Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) based on your requirements for exposing the Control Planes.

If you prefer using an NLB instead of ELB, you must specify annotations for the Service in the `k0smotronControlPlane`. These annotations guide the AWS Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) or the AWS Load Balancer Controller to create the respective services.

```yaml
 [...] 
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    apiPort: 6443
    konnectivityPort: 8132
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
```

For scenarios involving Classic ELBs or NLBs without special options, the AWS CCM can be utilized.

#### Internal NLB
If you aim to use the NLB and set the schema to `internal`, the target group attribute `preserve_client_ip.enabled=false` is required due to "hairpinning" or "NAT loopback". In such cases, the AWS CCM cannot be used because it doesn't support setting Target Group Attributes. Therefore, the AWS Load Balancer Controller, which has the ability to set Target Group Attributes, becomes necessary. Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html) to install the AWS Load Balancer Controller.

```yaml
 [...] 
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    apiPort: 6443
    konnectivityPort: 8132
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "external" # AWS Loadbalancer Controller creates a NLB when type is "external"
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-group-attributes: preserve_client_ip.enabled=false
```

***Note:*** Please make sure that the Security Group does allow the access to the NLB on port 6443 and 8132 from the management cluster nodes. This access is crucial for Cluster API (CAPI), Cluster API Provider for AWS (CAPA), and k0smotron, as they require access to the Control Plane API. Additionally, the port for the Konnectivity service need to be accessible from worker nodes.

## Accessing the workload cluster

To access the child cluster we can get the kubeconfig for it with `clusterctl get kubeconfig k0s-aws-test`. You can then save it to disk and/or import to your favorite tooling like [Lens](https://k8slens.dev).

## Deleting the cluster

For cluster deletion, do **NOT** use `kubectl delete -f my-aws-cluster.yaml` as that will result in orphan AWS resources. Instead, delete the top level `Cluster` object. This approach ensures the proper sequence in deleting all child resources, effectively avoiding orphan resources.
